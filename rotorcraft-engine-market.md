<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Rotorcraft Engine Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Multiple Rotor</li><li>Single Rotor</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The rotorcraft engine market is divided into two main types: single rotor and multiple rotor systems. Single rotor designs, typically seen in traditional helicopters, feature one main rotor for lift, relying on a tail rotor for stability. This configuration is simpler and often lighter. In contrast, multiple rotor systems, such as those found in quadcopters and other unmanned aerial vehicles, utilize several rotors to enhance lift, stability, and maneuverability, allowing for advanced applications and greater payload capacities.</p></p>
