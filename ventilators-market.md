<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Ventilators Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Positive Pressure Mechanical Ventilators</li><li>Negative Pressure Mechanical Ventilators</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The ventilators market comprises primarily two types: positive pressure mechanical ventilators and negative pressure mechanical ventilators. Positive pressure devices, commonly used in critical care, deliver air directly into the lungs, assisting or controlling the patient's breathing. They are prevalent in hospitals for treating respiratory distress. In contrast, negative pressure ventilators create a vacuum around the chest, facilitating lung expansion by reducing pressure externally. These are less common today but can be beneficial for patients with specific respiratory conditions.</p></p>
